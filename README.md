# Coin List
he Coin Listing app is a demo application that displays information about cryptocurrencies. The data is stored on a web server as a REST web service.

This application demonstrates the use of [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to send requests to the web service and [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) to parse the returned JSON data into Kotlin data objects.

In my project, I additionally use Manual Dependency Injection and MVVM architecture.
